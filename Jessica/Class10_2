In Dr. Gabler's lecture I learned quite a bit about different ways to use statistics in analysis. I don't have a strong statistics background so it was a lot of information to take in. Most of what I learned was that I need to learn more and intend to do so. It was nice to see that there are different packages available for different analysis. I will try to keep that in mind if I'm ever looking for an analysis to fit in a different way/shape/form.
